# User List

## About 

User List is another project I built whilst taking [React The Complete Guide course curriculum](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
The app allows you to add user information with built-in validation for name and age fields.

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`
